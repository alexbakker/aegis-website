# Aegis website

This repository contains the source of Aegis' website, hosted at:
https://getaegis.app.

The website theme is based on the [Sienna
Template](https://bitbucket.org/pasqualevitiello/sienna), but was adapted so
that it can be built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

## Build

To build the website, first install
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing). Make sure to get the
extended version for Sass support).

Then run ``hugo`` in the root of this repository. The generated website will be
available in the ``public`` folder.
